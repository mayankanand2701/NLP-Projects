## Autosuggestion App

Welcome to the AutoSuggestion app! This application utilizes NLP concepts and the Jaccard distance algorithm to provide users with word suggestions based on similarity.

## Description

The AutoSuggestion app allows users to input a word, and the app's algorithm will generate and display the next 10 most similar words based on the Jaccard distance metric. Jaccard distance measures the dissimilarity between two sets by comparing their intersection and union, making it suitable for word similarity tasks.
